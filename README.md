# Laravel 6 Real Estate / Venues Management with Adminpanel

Transformed [Bootstrap theme Homespace](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/homespace/) into a mini-clone of [Hirespace.com](https://hirespace.com) portal, fully manageable with adminpanel generated with [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com), 
to manage all the venues, locations, event types.

Also added SEO important stuff like Articles Slugs in URLs.
